# Rock Paper Scissors Game

Made a simple console game of Rock Paper Scissors with available restart and scoring system.<br>

Added a list to track player`s choices. Upon reaching 5 choices, they will be counted and if there is a choice whose count is bigger than the others, the computer will use the word that counters it. If the counts are equal, the computer will switch to randomness. <br>
